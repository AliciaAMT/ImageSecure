In simple words: I've done my very best to create a reliable and secure way of handling files uploaded by your website(s) visitors. However, I cannot guarantuee that it's 100% secure! The internet is ever changing and at some point, someone will find a way to circumvent the security measures I've put in place. That's why I have to add "Use at your own risk!". If something happened that shouldn't happen, make a new issue. I will do my best to fix it as soon as possible!<br/><br/>
If you wish to distribute the class (with or without changes made to it), please leave the copyright notice in place.
